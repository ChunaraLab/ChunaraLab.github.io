## Course Overview
This set of 5-modules, which can be delivered as a short course or workshop(s), will introduce and encourage thinking around new data and analytic methods in public health. Topics relay and provide an introductory view to the importance of the entire data science pipeline, across data gathering, processing, analysis and communication. Content includes summaries of current and best practices from the literature, discussion of research papers and approaches to address methodological challenges. Methods will also be situated in context of public health priorities, relevant across non-communicable and communicable disease, maternal, perinatal, nutritional topics and injuries. Students are encouraged to bring their own dataset or use publicly available ones to develop their own data science project, and amongst other learning opportunities, time can be allotted for discussing project challenges.

## Pre-requisites
This course will be a good introduction for anyone interested in learning how data science can be used in public health and biomedicine, and what kinds of skills and problems are involved. Previous exposure and experience in epidemiology, biostatistics research and/or practice will be assumed, and analytic methods introduced in context of such fields. In particular, students should have some experience working with data and a working knowledge of the principles of linear regression and statistics. Course examples will be in R so a working knowledge will also be required, or students should go through an online introduction prior to enrolling.

## Learning Opportunitiess
The modules are designed around the following types of learning opportunities, providing a mix of hands-on interpretation, implementation and discussion.
<ul>
<li>Analyses: A case study will be described, and with sample code, students will implement a machine learning analysis, identifying methodological and substantive tradeoffs in the implementation process.
</li>
<li>Project: Students will, with their own or a provided dataset, design an analysis appropriate for a task of their choosing. With the instructor, students will work through common challenges in the design and potentially in implementation of the approach.
</li>
<li>Readings: State-of-the-art studies using machine learning in public health will be read and methodological, health contributions and ethical issues will be studied and discussed.
</li>
<li>Design: Students will design visualization and communication appropriate for the example problem(s).
</li>
</ul>
